# My Jekyll Extensions

These are the extensions that I'm using for my personal blog at [BrianMcMurray.com](http://brianmcmurray.com).

These are based off plugins from RFelix, Jose Diaz-Gonzalez, and Roger Lopez.

These extensions use [_jekyll_ext_](http://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext), which allows you to extend the Jekyll static blog generator without forking and modifying it's codebase.

With this code, not only do your extensions live in your blog directory, but they can also be shared and reutilized.

Use these extensions with _jekyll_ext_ by just cloning this repo into the *\_extensions* dir of your blog: `git clone git://github.com/bmcmurray/my_jekyll_extensions.git _extensions`

More information about _jekyll_ext_ can be found here: [Jekyll Extensions -= Pain](http://rfelix.com/2010/01/19/jekyll-extensions-minus-equal-pain/)
